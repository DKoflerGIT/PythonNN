# PythonNN
Framework built from scratch for modelling dense neural networks and backpropagation. The aim of this project was to explore the concept of neural networks and explore various approaches to improve the learning process. Most of the concepts are taken from the book "Neural Networks" by David Kriesel (https://www.dkriesel.com/science/neural_networks)
